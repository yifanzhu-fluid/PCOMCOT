# PCOMCOT
PCOCMOT is a high-efficiency parallel computer program for simulating nonlinear dispersive tsunami waves. It is developed with the motivation to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy for large-scale tsunami simulations. The main features of PCOMCOT include:
1) Accounting for wave dispersion by adding non-hydrostatic pressure to the shallow water model COMCOT;
2) Moving boundary technique for run-up and run-down;
3) Eddy-viscosity scheme for wave breaking;
4) One-way and two-way grid nesting for cross-scale tsunami modeling;
5) Parallel implementation with MPI library.

PCOMCOT is developed by Yifan Zhu and Prof. Chao An at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. We make the source code open without limitations on its redistribution and modification for research purposes. The current version of PCOMCOT is 2.0. We will keep updating the source code, manual, and examples when new features or modules are added in the future. 

If you find bugs of the program or plan to use PCOMCOT commercially, please contact Yifan Zhu at zyftop@sjtu.edu.cn or Chao An at anchao@sjtu.edu.cn.
