# PCOMCOT
PCOCMOT is a high-efficiency parallel computer program for simulating nonlinear dispersive tsunami waves. It is developed with the motivation to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy for large-scale tsunami simulations. The main features of PCOMCOT include:
1) Accounting for wave dispersion by adding non-hydrostatic pressure to the shallow water model COMCOT;
2) Moving boundary technique for run-up and run-down;
3) Eddy-viscosity scheme for wave breaking;
4) One-way and two-way grid nesting for cross-scale tsunami modeling;
5) Parallel implementation with MPI library.
