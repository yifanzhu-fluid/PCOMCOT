The following explains the naming system used for measured ASCII data files acquired during 
tsunmai physica modeling experiments conducted at the Coastal and Hydraulic Laboratory, 
Engineer Research and Development Center.

Tsunami Benchmark #2: Runup of Solitary Waves on a Circular Island and 

Problem #2, "Runup of Solitary Waves on a Circular Island" 

The wave-paddle trajectories are stored in file FDBK2ABC.TXT.  A total of 10
sec from 22 to 32 sec (25 Hz sampling rate) is listed for each case in units of cm. 
Four columns are labeled "Time," "Case A," "Case B," "Case C." 

The surface elevation time series for gages 1-4, 6, 9, 16, and 22 for cases A, B, 
and C are stored in files TS2A.TXT, TS2B.TXT, and TS2Cnew1.TXT, respectively. 
A total of 60 sec of data is included for all gages.

Three files contain the runup height distributions for Cases A, B, and C,
respectively. They are named RUN2A.TXT, RUN2B.TXT, and RUN2C.TXT. 
Each file has four columns of data named "Rad", "Deg", "Max Vert Runup, cm"
(Average of 2 runs), and "R/d" (runup normalized by water depth).  Note that the
24 values are not evenly spaced around the perimeter. Sixteen were evenly
spaced every 22.5 deg around the perimeter.  Four radial transects with uneven
spacing (i.e. 2.5 and 5.0 deg) were located on the back side of the island (i.e. 90
deg) to improve the resolution in this critical area.
